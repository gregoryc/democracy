Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
