Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
