Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
