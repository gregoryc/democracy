Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
