Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
