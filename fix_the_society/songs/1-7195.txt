Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
