Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
