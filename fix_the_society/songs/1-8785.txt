Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

An open conversation, they always divert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
