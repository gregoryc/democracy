Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
