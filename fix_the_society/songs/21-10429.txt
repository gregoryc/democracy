Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
