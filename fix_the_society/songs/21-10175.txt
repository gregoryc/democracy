Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
