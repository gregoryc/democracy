Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
