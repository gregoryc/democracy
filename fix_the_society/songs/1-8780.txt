Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
