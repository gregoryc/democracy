Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
