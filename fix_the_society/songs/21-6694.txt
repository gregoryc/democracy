Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
