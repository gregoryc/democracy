Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
