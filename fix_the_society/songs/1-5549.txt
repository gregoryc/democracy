Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
