Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
