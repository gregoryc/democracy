Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
