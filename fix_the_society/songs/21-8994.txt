Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
