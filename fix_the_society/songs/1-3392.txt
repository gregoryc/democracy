Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
