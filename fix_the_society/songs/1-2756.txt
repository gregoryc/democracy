Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
