Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
