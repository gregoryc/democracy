Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
