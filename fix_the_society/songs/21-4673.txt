Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
