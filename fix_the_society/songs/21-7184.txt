Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
