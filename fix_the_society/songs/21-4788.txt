Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
