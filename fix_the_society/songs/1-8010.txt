VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
