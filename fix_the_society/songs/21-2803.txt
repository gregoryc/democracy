Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
