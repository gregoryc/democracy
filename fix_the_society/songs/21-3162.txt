Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
