Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
