Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
