Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
