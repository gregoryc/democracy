Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
