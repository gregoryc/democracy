Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
