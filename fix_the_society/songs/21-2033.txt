Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
