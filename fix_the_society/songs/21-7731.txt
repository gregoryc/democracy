Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
