VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
