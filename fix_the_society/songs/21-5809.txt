Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
