Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
