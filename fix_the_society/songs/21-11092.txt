Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
