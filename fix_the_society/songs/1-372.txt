Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
