Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
