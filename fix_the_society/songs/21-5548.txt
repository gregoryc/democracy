Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
