Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
