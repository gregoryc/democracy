Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't alter anything, they are inert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
