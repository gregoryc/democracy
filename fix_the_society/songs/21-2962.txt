Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
