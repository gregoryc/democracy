Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
