Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
