Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
