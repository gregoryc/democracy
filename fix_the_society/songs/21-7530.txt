Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
