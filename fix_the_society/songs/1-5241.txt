Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
