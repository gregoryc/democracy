Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
