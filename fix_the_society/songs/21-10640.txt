Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
