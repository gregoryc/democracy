Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
