Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
