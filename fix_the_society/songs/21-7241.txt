Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
