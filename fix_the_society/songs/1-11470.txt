Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
