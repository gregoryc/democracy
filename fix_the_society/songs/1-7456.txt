Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
