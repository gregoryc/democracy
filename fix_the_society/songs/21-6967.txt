Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
