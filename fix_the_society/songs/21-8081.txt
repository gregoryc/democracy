Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
