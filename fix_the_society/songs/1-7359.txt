Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
