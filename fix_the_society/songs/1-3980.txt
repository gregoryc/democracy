Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
