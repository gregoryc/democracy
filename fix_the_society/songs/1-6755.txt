Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
