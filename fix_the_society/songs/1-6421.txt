Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
