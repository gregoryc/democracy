Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
