Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
