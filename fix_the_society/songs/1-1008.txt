VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

I must speak here, I must interject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
