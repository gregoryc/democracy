Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
