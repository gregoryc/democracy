Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
