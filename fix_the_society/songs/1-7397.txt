Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

This is plain, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
