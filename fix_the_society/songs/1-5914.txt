Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
