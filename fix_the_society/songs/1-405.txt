Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

I must speak here, I must interject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

I must speak here, I must interject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
