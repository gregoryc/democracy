Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
