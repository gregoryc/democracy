Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
