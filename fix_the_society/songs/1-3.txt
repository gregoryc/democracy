VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
