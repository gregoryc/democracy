Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
