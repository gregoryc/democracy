Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Whining and crying like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
