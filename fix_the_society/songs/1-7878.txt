Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
