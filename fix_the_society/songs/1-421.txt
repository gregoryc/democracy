Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
