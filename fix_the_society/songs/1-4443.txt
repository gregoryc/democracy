Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
