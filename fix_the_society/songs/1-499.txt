Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
