Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
