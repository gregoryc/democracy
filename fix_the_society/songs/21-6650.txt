Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
