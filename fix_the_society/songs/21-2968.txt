Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
