Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
