Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
