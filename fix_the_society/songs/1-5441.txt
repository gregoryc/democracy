VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
