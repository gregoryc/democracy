Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
