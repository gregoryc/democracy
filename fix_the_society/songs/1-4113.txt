Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
