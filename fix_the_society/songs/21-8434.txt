Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
