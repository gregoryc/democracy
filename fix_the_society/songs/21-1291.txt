Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
