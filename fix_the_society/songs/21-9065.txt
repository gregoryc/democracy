Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
