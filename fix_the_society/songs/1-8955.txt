Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
