Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
