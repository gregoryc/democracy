Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
