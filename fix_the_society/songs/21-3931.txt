Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
