Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
