Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
