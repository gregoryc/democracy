Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
