Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
