Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
