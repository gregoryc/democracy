Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Reason is what they want to discard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
