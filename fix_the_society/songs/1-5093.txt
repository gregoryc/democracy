Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
