Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
