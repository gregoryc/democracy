Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
