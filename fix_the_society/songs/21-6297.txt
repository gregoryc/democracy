Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
