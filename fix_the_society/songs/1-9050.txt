Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
