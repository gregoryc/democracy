Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
