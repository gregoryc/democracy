Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
