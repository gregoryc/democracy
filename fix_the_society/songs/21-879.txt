Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
