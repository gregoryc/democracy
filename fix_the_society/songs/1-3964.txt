Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
