Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
