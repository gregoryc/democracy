Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
