Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
