Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
