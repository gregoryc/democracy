Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
