Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
