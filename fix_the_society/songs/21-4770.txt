Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
