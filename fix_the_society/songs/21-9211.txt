Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
