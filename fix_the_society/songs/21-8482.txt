Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
