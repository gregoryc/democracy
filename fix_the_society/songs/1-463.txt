Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is plain, anyone can detect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
