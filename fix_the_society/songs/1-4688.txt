Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
