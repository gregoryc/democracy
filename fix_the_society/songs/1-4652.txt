Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
