Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
