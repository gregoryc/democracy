Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
