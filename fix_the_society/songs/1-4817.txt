Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
