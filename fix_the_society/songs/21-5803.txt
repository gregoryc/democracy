Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
