Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
