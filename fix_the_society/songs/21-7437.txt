Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
