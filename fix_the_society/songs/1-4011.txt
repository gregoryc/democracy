VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
