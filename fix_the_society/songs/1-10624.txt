Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
