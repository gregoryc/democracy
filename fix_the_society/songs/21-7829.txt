Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
