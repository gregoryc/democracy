Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
