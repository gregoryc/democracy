Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
