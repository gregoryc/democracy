Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
