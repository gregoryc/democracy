Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
