Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
