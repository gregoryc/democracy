Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS
