Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
