Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
