Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
