Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
