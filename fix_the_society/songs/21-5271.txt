Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
