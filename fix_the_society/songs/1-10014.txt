VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
