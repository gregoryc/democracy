Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
