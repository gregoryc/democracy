Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
