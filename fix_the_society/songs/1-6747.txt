Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
