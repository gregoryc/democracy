Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
