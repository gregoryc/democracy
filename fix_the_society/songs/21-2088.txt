Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
