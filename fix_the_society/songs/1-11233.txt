Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
