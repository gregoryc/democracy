Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
