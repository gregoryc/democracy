Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
