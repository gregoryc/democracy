Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
