Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
