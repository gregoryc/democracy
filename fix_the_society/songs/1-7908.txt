Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
