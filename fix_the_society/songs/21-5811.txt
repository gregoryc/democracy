Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
