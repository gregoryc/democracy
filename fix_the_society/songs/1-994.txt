Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
