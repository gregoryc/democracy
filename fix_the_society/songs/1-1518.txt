Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
