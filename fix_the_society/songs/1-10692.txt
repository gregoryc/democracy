Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
