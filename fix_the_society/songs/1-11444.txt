Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
