Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
