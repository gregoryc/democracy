Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
