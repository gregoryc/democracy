Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
