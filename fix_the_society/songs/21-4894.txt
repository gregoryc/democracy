Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
