Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
