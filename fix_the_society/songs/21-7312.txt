Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
