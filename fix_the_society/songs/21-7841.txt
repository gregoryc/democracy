Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
