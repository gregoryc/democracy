Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
