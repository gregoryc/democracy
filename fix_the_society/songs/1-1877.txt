Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
