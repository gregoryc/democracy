VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
