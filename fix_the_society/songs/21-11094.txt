Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
