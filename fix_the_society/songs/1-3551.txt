Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
