Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
