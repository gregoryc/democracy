VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
