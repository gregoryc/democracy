Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
