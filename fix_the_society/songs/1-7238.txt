VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
The society is the ones who hurt
