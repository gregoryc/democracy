Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
