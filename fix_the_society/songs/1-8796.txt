Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
