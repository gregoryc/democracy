VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
