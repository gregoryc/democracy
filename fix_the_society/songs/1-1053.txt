Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
