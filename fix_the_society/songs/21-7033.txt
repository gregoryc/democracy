Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
