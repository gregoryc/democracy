Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
