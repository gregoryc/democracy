Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
