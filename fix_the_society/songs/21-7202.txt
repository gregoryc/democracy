Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
