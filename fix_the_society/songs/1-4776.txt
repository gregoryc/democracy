Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
