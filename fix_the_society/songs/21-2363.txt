Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
