Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
