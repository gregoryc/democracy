Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
