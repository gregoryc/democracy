Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
