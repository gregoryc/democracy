Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
