Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
