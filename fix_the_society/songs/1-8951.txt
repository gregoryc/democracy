Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Science is  fundamentally inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
