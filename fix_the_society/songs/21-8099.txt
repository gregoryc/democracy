Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
