Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
