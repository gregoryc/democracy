Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
