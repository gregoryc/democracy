Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
