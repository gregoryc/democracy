Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too insidious for many to detect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
