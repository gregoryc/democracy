Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
