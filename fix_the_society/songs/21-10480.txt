Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
