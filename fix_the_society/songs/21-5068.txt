Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
