Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
