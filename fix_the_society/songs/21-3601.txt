Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
