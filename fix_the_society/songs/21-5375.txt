Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
