Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
