Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
