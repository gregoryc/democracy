Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
