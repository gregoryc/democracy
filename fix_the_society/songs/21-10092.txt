Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
