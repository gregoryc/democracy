Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
