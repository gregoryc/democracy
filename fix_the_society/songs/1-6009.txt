Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
