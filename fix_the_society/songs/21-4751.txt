Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
