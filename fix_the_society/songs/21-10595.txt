Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
