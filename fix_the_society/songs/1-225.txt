Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
