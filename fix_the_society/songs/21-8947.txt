Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
