Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
