Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
