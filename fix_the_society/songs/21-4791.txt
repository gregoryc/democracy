Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
