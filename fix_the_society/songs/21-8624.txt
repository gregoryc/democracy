Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
