Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
