Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
