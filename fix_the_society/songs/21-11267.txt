Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
