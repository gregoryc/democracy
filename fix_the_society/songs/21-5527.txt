Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
