Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
