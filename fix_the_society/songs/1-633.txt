Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
