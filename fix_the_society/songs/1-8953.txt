Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
