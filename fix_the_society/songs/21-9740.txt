Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
