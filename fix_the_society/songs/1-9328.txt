Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
