Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
