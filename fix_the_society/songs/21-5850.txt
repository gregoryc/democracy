Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
