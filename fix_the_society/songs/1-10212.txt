Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
