Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
