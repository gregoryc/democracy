VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
