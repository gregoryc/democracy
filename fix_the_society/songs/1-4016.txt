Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
