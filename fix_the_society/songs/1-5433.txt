Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
