Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
