Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
