Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
