Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
