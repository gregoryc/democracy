Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
