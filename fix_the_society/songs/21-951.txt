Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
