Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
