Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
