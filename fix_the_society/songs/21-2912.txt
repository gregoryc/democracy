Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
