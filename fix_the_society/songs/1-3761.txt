Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
