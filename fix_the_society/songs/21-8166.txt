Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
