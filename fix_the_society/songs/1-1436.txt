Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
