Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
