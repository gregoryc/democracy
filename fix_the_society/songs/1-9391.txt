Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
