Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Whining and crying like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
