Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
