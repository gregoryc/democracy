Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
