Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
