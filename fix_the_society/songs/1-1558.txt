Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
I must speak here, I must interject

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
