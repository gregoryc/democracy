Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
