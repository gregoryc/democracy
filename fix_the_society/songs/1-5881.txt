Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
