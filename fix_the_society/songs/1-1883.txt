Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is plain, anyone can detect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
