Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
