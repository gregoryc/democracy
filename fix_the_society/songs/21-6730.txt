Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
