Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
