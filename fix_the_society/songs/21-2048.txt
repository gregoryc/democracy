Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
