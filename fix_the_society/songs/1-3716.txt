Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
