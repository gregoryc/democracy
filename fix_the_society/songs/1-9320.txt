Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
I must speak here, I must interject

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
I must speak here, I must interject

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
