Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
