Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
