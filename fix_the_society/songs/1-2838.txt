Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
