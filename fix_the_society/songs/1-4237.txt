Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
