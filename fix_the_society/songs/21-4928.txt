Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
