Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
