Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
