Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
