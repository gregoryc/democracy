Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
