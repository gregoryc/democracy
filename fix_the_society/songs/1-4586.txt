Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
