Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
