Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
