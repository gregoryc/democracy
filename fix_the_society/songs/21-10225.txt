Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
