Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
