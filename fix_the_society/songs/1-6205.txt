Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
