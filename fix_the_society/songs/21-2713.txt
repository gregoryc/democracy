Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
