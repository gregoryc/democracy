Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
