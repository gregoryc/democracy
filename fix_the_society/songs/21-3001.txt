Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
