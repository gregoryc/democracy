Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
