Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
