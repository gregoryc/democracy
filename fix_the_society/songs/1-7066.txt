Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
The society is the ones who hurt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
