Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
