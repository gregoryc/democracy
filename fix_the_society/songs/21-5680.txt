Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
