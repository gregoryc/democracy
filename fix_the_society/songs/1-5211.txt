Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
