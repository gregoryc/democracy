Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
