Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
