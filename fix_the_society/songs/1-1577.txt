VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
