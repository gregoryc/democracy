Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
