VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
