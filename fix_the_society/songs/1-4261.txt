Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
