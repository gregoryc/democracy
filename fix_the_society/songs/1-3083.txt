VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
