Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
