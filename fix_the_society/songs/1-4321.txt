Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
