Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
