Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
