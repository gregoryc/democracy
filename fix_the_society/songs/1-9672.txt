Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
