Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
