Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
