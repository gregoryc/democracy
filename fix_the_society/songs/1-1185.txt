Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Reason is what they want to discard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Reason is what they want to discard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
