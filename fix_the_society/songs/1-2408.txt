Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
