Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
