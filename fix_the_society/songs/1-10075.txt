Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
