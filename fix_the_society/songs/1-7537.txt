VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
