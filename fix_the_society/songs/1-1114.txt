Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
