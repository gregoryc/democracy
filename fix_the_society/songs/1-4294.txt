Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
