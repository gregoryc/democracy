Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
I must speak here, I must interject

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
