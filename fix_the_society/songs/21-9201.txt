Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
