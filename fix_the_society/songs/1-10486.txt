VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
