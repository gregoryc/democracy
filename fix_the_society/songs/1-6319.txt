VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and crying like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
