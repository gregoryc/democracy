Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
