Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
