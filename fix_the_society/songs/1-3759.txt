Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
