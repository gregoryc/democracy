Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
