Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
