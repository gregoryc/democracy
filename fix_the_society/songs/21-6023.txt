Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
