Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
