Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
