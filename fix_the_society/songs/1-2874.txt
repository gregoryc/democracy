Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
