Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Whining and moaning like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
