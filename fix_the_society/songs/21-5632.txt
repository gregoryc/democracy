Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
