Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
