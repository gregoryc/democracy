Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
