Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
