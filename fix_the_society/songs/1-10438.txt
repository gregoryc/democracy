VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
