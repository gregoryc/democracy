Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
