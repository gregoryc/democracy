Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
