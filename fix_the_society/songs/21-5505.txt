Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
