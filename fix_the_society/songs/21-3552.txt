Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
