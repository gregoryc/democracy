VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
