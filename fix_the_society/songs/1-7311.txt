VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
