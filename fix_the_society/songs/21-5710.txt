Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
