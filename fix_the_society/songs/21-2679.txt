Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
