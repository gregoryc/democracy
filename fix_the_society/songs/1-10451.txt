Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They do junk, they do dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
