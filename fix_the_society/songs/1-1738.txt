Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
