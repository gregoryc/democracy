Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
