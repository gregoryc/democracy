Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
