Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
