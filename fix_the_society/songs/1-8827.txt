Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too insidious for many to detect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
