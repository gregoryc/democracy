Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
