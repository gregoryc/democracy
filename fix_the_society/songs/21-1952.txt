Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
