Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
