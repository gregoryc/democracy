Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
