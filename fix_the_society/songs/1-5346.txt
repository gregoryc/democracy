Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
