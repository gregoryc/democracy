VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
