Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
