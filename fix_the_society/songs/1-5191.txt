Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
