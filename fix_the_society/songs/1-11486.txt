Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS
