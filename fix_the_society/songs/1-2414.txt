Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
