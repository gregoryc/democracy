Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
