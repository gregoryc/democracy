Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
