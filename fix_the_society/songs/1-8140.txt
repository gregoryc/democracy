Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
