Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
