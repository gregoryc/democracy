Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
