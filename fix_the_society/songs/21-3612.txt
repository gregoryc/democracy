Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
