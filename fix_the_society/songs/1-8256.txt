Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
