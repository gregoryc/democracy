Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Evading conversation just like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
