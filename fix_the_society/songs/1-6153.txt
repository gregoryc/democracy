Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
