Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
