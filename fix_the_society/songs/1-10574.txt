Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
