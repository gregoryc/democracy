Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
