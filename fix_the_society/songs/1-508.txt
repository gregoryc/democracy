Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
