Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
