Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
