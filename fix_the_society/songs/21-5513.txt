Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
