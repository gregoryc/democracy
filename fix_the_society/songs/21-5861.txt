Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
