Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
