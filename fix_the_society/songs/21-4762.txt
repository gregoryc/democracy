Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
