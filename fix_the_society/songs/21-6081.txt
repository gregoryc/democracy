Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
