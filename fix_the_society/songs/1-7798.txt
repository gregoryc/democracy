Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
