Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
