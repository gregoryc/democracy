Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
