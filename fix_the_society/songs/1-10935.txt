Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
