Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
