Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
