Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
