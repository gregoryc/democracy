Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
