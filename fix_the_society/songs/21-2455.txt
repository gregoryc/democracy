Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
