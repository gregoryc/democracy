Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
