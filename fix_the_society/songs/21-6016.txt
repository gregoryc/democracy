Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
