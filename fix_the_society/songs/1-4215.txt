Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
