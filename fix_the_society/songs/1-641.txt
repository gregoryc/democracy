VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
