Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
