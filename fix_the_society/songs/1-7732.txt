Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
