Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
