Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
