Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
