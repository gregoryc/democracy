Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
