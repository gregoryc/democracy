Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
