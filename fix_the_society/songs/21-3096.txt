Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
