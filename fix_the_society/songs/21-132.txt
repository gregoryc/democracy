Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
