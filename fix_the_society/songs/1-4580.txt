Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
