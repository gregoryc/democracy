Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
