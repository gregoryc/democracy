Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
