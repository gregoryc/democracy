Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
