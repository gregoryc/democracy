Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
