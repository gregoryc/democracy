Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
