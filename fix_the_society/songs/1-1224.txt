VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
