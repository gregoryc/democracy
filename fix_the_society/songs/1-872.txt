VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
