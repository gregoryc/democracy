Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
