Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
