Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
