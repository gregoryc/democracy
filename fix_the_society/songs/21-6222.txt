Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
