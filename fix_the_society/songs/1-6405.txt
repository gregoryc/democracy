Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
