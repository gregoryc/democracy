Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
