Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
