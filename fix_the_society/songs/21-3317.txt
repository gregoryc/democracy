Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
