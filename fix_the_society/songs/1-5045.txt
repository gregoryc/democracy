Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
