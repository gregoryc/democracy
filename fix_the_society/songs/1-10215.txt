Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
