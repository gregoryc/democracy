Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
