Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
