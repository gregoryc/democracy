Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
