Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
