Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
