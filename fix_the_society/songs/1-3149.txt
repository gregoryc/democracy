Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
