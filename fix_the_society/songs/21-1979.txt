Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
