Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
