Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
