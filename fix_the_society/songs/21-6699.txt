Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
