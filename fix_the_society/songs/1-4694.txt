Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
