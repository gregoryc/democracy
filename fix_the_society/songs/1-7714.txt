Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
