Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
