Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
