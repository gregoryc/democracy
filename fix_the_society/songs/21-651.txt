Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
