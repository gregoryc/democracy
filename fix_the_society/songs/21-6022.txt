Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
