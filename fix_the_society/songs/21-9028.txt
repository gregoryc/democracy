Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
