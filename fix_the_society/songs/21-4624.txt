Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
