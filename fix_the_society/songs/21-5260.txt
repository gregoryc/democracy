Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
