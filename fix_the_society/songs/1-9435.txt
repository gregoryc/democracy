Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
