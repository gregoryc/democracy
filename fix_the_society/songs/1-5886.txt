Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
