Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
