Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
