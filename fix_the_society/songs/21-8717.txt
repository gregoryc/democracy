Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
