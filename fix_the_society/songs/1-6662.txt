Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
