VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
