Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
