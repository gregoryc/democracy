Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
