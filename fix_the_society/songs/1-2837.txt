Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
