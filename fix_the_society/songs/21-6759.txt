Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
