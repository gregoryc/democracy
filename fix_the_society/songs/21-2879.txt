Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
