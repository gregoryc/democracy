Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is plain, anyone can detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
