Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
