Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
