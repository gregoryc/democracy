Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
