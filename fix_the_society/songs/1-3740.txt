Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
