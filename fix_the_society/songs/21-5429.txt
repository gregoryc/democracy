Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
