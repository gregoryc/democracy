Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
