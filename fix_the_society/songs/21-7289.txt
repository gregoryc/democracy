Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
