Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
