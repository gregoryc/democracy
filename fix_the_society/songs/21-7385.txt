Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
