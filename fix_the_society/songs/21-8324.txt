Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
