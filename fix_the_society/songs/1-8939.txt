Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
