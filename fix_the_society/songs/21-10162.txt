Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
