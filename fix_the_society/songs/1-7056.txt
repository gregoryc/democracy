Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
