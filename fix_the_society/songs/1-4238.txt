Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
