Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
