Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
