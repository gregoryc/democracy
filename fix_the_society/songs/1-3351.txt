Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
