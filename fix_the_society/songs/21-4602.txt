Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
