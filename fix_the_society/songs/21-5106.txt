Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
