Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
