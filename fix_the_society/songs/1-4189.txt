Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
