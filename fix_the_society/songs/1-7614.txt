VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
