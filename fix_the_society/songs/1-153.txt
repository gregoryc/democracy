Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
