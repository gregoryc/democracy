VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
