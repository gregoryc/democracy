Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
