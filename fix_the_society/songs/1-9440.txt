Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
