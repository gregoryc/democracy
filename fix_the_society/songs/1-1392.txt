Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
