Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
