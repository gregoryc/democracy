Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
