Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
