Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
