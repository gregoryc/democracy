Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
