Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
