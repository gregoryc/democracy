Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is obvious, anyone can detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
