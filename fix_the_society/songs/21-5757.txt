Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
