Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
