Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
