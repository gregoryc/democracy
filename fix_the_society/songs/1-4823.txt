Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
