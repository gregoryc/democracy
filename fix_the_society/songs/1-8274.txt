Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
