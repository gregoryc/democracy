Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
