Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
