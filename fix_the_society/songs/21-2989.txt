Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
