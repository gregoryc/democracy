Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
