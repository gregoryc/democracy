Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
