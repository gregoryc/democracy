VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
