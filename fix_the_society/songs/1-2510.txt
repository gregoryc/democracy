Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
