Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
