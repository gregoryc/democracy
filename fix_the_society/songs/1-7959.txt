Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
