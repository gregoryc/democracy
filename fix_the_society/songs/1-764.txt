Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
