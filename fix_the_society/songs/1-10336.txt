Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
