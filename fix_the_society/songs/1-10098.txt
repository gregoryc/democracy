Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
