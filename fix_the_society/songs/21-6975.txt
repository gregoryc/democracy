Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
