Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
