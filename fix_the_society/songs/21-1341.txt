Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
