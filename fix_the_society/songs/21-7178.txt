Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
