Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Inert science they consecrate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
