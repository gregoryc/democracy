Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
