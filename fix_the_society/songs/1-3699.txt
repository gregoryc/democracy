Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
