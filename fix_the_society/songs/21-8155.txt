Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
