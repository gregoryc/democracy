Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
