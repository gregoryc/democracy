Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
