Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This is too insidious for many to detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
