Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
