Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
