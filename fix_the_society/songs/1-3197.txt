Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
