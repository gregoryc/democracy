Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
