Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
