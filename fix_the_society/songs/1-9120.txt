Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
