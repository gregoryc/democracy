Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
