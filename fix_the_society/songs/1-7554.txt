Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
