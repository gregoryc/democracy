Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
