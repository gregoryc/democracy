Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
