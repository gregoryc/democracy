Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
