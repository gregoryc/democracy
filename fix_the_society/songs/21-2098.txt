Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
