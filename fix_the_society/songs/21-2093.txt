Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
