Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

You make broad statements while looking like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
