Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
