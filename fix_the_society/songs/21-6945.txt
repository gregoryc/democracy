Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
