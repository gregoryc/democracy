VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
