Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
