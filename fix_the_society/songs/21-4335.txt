Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
