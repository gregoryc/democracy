Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
