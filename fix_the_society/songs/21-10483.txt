Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
