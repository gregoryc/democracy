Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
