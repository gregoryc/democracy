Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
