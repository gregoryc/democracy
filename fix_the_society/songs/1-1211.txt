Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
