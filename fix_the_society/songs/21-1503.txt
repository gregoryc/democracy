Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
