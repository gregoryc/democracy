Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
