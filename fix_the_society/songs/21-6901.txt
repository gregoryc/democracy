Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
