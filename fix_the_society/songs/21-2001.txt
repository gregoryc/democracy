Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
