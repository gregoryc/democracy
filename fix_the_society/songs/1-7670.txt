Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
