Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
