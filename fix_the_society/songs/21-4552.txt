Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
