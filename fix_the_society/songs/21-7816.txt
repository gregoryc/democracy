Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
