Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
