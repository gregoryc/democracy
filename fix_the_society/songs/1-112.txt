Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
