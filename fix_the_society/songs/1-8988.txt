Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
