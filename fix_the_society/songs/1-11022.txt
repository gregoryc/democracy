Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
