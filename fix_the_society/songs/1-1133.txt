Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
