Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
