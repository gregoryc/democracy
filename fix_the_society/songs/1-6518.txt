Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
