Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
