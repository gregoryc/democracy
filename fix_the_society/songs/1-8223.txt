Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
