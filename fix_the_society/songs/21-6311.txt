Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
