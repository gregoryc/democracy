Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
