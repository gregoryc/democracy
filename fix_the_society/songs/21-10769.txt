Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
