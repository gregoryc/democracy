Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
