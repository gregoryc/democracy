Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
