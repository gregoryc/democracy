Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
