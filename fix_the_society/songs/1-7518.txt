Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
