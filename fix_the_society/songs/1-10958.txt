Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

I must speak here, I must interject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

I must speak here, I must interject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
