Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
