Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
