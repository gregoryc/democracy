Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
