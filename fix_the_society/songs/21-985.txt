Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
