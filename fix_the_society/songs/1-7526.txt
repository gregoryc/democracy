Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
