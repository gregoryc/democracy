Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
