Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
