Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
