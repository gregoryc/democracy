Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
