Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
