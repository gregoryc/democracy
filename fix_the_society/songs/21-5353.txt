Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
