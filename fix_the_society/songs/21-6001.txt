Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
