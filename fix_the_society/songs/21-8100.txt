Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
