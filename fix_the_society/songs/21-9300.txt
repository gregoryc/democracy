Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
