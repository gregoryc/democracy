Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
