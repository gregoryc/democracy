Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
