Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
