Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
