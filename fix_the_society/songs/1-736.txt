Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
