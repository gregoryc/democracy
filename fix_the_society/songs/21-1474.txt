Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
