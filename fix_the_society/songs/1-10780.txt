Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
