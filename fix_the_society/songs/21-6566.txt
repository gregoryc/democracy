Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
