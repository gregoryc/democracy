Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
