Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
