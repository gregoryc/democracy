Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
