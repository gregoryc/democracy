Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
