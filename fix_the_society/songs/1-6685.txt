Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
