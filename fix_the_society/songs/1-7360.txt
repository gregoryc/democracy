Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
