Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
