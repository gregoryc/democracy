Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
