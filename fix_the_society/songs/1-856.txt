Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
