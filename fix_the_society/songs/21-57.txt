Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
