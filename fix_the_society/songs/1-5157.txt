Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

I must speak here, I must interject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

I must speak here, I must interject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

I must speak here, I must interject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
