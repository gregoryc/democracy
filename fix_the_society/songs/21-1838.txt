Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
