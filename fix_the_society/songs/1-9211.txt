Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act like a retard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
