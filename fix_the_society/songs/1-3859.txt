Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
