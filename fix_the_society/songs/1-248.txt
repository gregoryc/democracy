Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
