Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
