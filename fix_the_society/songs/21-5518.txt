Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
