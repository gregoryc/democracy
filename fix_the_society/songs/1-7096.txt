Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
