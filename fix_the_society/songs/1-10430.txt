Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
