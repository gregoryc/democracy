Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
