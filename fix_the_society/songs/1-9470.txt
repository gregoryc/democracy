Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
