Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
