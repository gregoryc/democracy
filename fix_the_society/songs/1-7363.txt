Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
