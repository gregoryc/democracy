Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
