Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
