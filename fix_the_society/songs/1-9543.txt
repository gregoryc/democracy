Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
