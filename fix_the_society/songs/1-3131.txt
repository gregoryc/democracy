Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
