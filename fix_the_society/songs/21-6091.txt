Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
