Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
