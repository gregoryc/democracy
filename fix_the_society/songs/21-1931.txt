Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
