Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
