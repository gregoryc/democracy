Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
