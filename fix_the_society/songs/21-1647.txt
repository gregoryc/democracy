Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
