Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
