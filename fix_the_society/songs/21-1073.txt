Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
