Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
