Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
