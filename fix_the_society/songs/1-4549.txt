Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
