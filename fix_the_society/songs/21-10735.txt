Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
