Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
