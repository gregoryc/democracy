Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
