Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
