Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
