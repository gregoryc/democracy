Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
