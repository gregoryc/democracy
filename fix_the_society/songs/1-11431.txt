Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
