Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
