Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
