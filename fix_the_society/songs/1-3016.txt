Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
