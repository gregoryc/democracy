Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
