Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
