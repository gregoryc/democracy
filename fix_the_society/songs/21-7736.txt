Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
