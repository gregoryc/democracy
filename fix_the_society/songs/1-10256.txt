Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
