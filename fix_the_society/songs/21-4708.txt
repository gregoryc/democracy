Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
