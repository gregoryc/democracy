Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
