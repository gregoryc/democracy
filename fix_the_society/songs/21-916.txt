Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
