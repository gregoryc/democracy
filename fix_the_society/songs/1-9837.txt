Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
