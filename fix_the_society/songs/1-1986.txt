Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
