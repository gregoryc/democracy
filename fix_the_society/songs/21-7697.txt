Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
