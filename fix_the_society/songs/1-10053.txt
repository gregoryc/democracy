Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
