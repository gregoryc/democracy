Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
