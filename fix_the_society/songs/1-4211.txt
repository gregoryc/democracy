Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
