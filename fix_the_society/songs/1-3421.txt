Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
