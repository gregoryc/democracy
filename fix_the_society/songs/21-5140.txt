Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
