Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
