Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
