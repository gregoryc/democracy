Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
