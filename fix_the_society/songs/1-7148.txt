Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
