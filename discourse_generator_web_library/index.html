This, therefore, would result in new understandings and political social and economic actions that will lead to real change without necessarily offending we're making upset anyone particular political side. The foundation of democracy, of course, is is a high-quality emphasis on high-quality discussion about government and about any relevant or significant Topic in like the South. Obviously, the extent to which there is a quote high-quality discussion on quote in the current world is much, much, much, much, much, much, lower than it could be. Claiming that it is the only possible solution to relatively low quality discourse, but but it is certainly an effective solution, particularly if it is used on a wide scale. Reception about new section about democracy software technology hi there the software is called democracy soft the goal of it is to bring about better better discussion and better a disk or a spy by empowering people to come up with better Communications that that better reflects their own personal thoughts and values. It is not trying to change the way that people think, it is instead of trying to help people to think, and to come up with with higher-quality discourse in sentences and responses to to Communications. How many times in your life have you heard or seen sentences four paragraphs that were extremely curly stated or formed, and that only exacerbated divisiveness and negative feelings? How many times in your life have you seen very intelligent YouTube or Twitter comments that that serve no meaningful purpose and didn't reflect a well-thought-out view on the political right or political left? Many people feel like they don't have the time have the motivation have the support or have the encouragement to the form or state well-thought-out arguments or our statements. Very often, as well, people don't even necessarily know or understand their own thoughts feelings and Views about many, many, topics, and therefore the people would not know how to express themselves, how to articulate their on feelings. This, of course, can be very problematic: just look at the current political situation in the United States. There are two very very big ring different sides that that have very different views but but have tremendous difficulty communicating  with each other or expressing their thoughts to each other can be very problematic and not ideal. List of course can be very problematic and not ideal. The goal of this software is to enable people, possibly for the first time, to engage in high quality discourse whereby people can can foramen can Gap much higher quality thoughts has a result. People don't jump through hoops to use it it's intuitive and natural. But the results can be quite obviously very significant and have very significant implications on many things if use sufficiently.

But the results can be quite obviously very significant and have very significant implications on many things if use sufficiently. Since there's a library any any websites on the entire internet can embed this on to their site.  This means that Twitter Facebook Gmail YouTube excetera excetera I'm bad at this library on their site and and use the software natively. This of course is very potent because because this would encourage people who have never heard of this software before to try to engage in to try to come up with high-quality Communications who wouldn't have otherwise any sites on the internet from any country of any level of magnitude can use does library on this software to to make its users or its customers engage in more civil discussion or discourse. Obviously social media sites would or should love this they don't love this that that should be a pretty clear marker or indication of systemic corruption a quality or characteristic which which unfortunately is possibly part of quote big Tech unquote. And the current Internet landscape there are many social media sites and new sites can come up perhaps if Google or Facebook did not want to use the software are smaller and more freedom focussed alternatives to Big Tex social media sites I'd become more popular. Such quite probably would be a very good thing.
      New section about anti-socialist throughout human history even beings have been had become quite accustomed to living in tribes and Plex indeed modern social theory and certain modern Sciences believe that that man has lived in clicks for millions of years and has developed and evolved certain characteristics in the context of tribes and cliques regardless of whether such such idea ideas and theories are true or false it is very clear clear and evident that that mankind throughout history and currently has lived in very isolated and divided units. This is not good. All people should be United in one empathetic, understanding, and United whole.  The United States, perhaps, has some resemblance to a theoretical state of quotes Unity unquote but of course, the United States has a tremendous number of problems as well. One common factor that that runs through, unfortunately, all current groups cliques and tribes and nation in the current world is the condition of quote anti-socialist unquote. This quality running through many many people as well many people don't want to socialize with with one another many people are introverted and many people mine to their devices groups and hobbies. This is very not necessary and not ideal. People could be far more trusting one another and people can be far more open to one another. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done in terms of making people be less afraid less introverted less less shy less inhibited more intelligent and having better communication with one another. The routes, the only routes, would have to lie in people we have to lie. There's no other way at all Dash in and people engaging in more high quality Communications with each other, and then people caring more about each other. How there can be broken families for no other reason that then the family members have some trouble talking to each other and some trouble being being I'm intelligent and honest with each other, totally horrible. There is absolutely no necessary reason for this. Any any claim that the current human Condition is quote scientifically necessary on quote is false is nonsense and would be alright pseudoscience. No The Human Condition could be very very different from how it is now one major step of course would be the abolition of nuclear bombs. But to happen can only be brought about through higher quality discourse higher-quality understanding higher quality communication and more understandings between people between men and between women. It is very clear that the United States is antisocial, Russia is antisocial, China is very antisocial, and call Nations. But there is validity and Merit in those in those Nations skepticism, because most people in the current world, are very very very out of touch with each other. This is not good. One very very different thing that is come about recently in the last 50 years, is a modern technology and modern computers. Through the use of modern computers modern smartphones and modern Computing devices of various kinds, new new technology has made people to realize that which they actually think. That is people can can have things that that augment their lives seamlessly easily and simply, that would help people to become smarter members of a democracy or smarter if members of a society. Such technology can bring about democracy in places where there is no democracy  such as China or certain countries in the Middle East. Such changes happens even in countries in which there is no democracy such changes happened even without Technologies. Tried to help people to come up with more meaningful more truthful more profound or more for more on well well written or well spoken Communications. Observation alone, Knology can bring about social change without the use of applications that would make people be more intelligent and where are they now I'm at 2 to try and improve the society or or circumstances in the society. One Good Reason then, that even larger changes could could come about and it society which is a what does 1 actually democratic and actually tries to engage in an unbiased discussion debate and discourse about things and two if if people widely used applications and software that tried to help them be be more intelligent people and to better. The potentials of of this category of technology or category of software is quite a mess oh, it could theoretically fix just about any problem with the current world. Different it's valuable that people share Technologies such as democracy software. Since it is BSD licensed anyone can act modify the code and do anything with this software I can customize the software at 4 there for their particular site where there a particular desktop program. New section about capitalism capitalism can work quite well and is a very Dynamic model but it fails when people don't genuinely critique institutions that have have a large extent of power in the society such as the case right now in the United States in states such as California there are tremendous problems with homelessness with with wage disparity with a variety of things. But the root cause of this is that people people that do rich people and poor people the the bridge was a and the proletariat aren't able to engage in peaceful and sensible discussion with each other theoretically if if the more wealthy members of California were more ethical and better people they wouldn't donate more of their money to a variety of constructive because they are there too many personal problems too many insecurities too many fears and anxieties negative emotions Etc that the make them want to be greedy and make them on a Ford things. Religion may or may not be a relevant Factor, but but the fundamental reason why such people don't do good actions and good deeds and donate money and and spends there a large amounts of money, is that there are real metal and securities in there in their minds that have come about as a result of thousands of years of criminality problems various things that are caused by rather directly a lack of high-quality communication between human between men and women. Therefore this there fourth degree of California's rich is quite Justified and actually make sense. There's natural rational reason there are actual rational reasons why such people who are money. But things don't need to be that way. Such people could I become relieved of all their Petty and securities, and such people could become much, much, better human being and the pain better members of California on society. The solution would lie in and the bourgeoisie and the proletariat the rich and the poor whichever term you want to use engaging in more open more transparent and we're honest discourse this website can bring about that kind of discourse provided that people to use this site therefore dissemination and advertising of this website and this offer is very very significant. The problems of Communism and the problems of free market capitalism both of them can be solved by just getting just getting people to talk and and making sure that people do talk. But not just talking anyway. There needs to be a very very very high level of discourse. I got to be brought about through the use of this technology and this software. Try playing around with a sighted and try using the and try using the site. Try sharing this site on various social media websites. That would be tremendously helpful for society. New section about ideology throughout history many human beings have developed many different philosophies and ideologies about life about Society about economics about liberal values and about a whole host of cama cama cama en about a whole host of other subjective phenomena. All ideologies could could have some Merit or could you could go by wrongly. Ideology quotes what is not necessarily a bad thing but but the extent to which a sensible one would work would be the would equal more or less indirect racial the extent to which society is filled with seeing people who engage in very very high quality discussion and discourse about important topics. Such discourse I'm to be things as simple as asking relevant questions and relevant context such as such as a job context but I could also include such things as as electing leaders or or protesting circumstances even in very restrictive countries the individual doesn't matter some extent because people do complain and people do protest about various problems and grievances. The resolution of post ideological and quotes problems or issues with weather come about when people can talk to each other well. Since this website is BSD license anyone can Taylor this this Library since this website is BSD license anyone can Taylor at this Library if their websites personal needs or where for when's personal goals dissection about social alienation many people in society can feel very put off I'm by the rise of China by loss of freedoms, democracy, religion, certain rights, etc etc. Such the root cause of all of them is simply the fact that people can have difficulty communicating with each other. For example look at the current United States. Social alienation will become less and less of a doctor when people can start to genuinely communicate well. New section about the author Gregory Cohen currently this website of the software that is created by one individual and one person only not a Consortium of different people not a group of different people but just one individual. I would very much like many people to work on this software and create different versions of the software. There be nothing wrong with that. It'll be a very very good thing. And because this code is open source and it is free Libre and open source software anyone could submit changes and updates to to the source, the source code is located at ruby gems dot-com gems democracy I am 26 years old and have no formal University or computer science degree I am just a new sentence I'm a self-taught programmer who knows a lot about computers but frankly hates current programmer and suffer culture., because many programmers don't seem to necessarily be very well around people who value genuine True Value Western values in their fullest. This is unfortunate. I feel that many many more people in the current world should be programmers but I feel that programming should probably be a predominantly women's feels it could very well compliment genuinely useful software I mean Dash traditional women's activities activities that what that would help to Super supports nurture and care for the members of a I'm a society with household. Indeed the first programmer in human history was female and programming should be probably 70% or more female but but quote programming husband has been misused and abused and taken and very very wrong directions and the average programmer in the current world is is more or less a slave to two large corporations who want certain things to be done programmers making very Keller made things that would have put that would help people to become more comfortable staying and happy and their circumstances programmers our program has asked more or less like a robots for it for for a capitalistic institutions and how many cases can be quite replaceable. This is not good. It's possible that many such programmers will have no role in the future encourage more people to try programming for its own sake and not for the sake of getting a job or doing business if you want to make money you can become an entrepreneur and and take. Control of everything. But being a slave for for institutional that probably has not used  offer yet this software yet could be a very very bad thing however and I said I definitely didn't say this if you work for an organization however I should however however definitely save this if you work for an organization that is ethical and that's and that cares about having discussions with its workers and is in the contacts of a very healthy and well functioning Society then then being a programmer or being a slave for a company, small or large, wouldn't have to be that bad and could even be a fulfilling sensible and constructive activity and use of time. However many programmers in the current world just make little gadgets are widgets of no consequence and cannot feel or felt felt felt fulfilled. This is not good there are some very easy programming languages that people can get into like Ruby or my own language that I've been created recently which is called C plus equals to. I have frankly had difficulty finding other people who have been on the same page as a meat. I would love to find more entrepreneurial minded people who genuinely would like to help other people, and who don't necessarily follow follow social trends. New section about the Creator th this entire website application and library was created by only one person currently Gregory's Towing. No other contributions so far have been made whether it be a financial or or in terms of code. Donations would be greatly appreciate it and donations could and would be used to a large extent in order to advertise this service more. Current political stagnation in the United States many many people and and states can feel quite stagnant in terms of their political and economic States and and conditions this is this is not necessary all Quote stagnation with Tom about nearly as a result of a of a human being is not knowing how to communicate high-quality Communications with one another there is also the factor of nuclear bombs and the the constant fear and anxiety that the weapons of mass destruction can can bring about in all societies and the current planet, however, given enough Central discourse, and perhaps given enough people forced to to use Technologies like the safe, denuclearization is quite possible in and has happened in multiple countries already on the past 100 years. The quote nucleus Care on quote is not necessary and if it's possible to live in a state in the United Democratic Society that that doesn't have I have a constant fear a major violence and that doesn't have a a constant just don't being scared. For the use of this website and this Library such a condition could genuinely and sincerely and be brought about therefore I highly highly recommend that sensible people on the basis of on the basis of Common Sense use this website share this website and if you want to and if you have it within your means donate money to me so that I can be supportive and so that I can share disseminate distributes got the site out and make the site used by many many people by the masses I sincerely want this I want one and I think any sane human being would want this as well so if you could just make a donation or contribution that they'll be quite valuable and you would be doing the genuinely Good Deed four-sided new section about this app this idea I got this idea on this idea was formed on September 19th of 2021. It is quite a new idea but it is quite potent. The code of this app is democracy jam and and that code has been downloaded more than 5,000 times currently
